### Hi there 👋
I'm Leonardo Lima , a passionate developer and tech. I currently work as a freelance front-end developer.
With more than 3 years of experience in the field, I had the opportunity to work on several exciting projects and explore different technologies.



###🚀 Expertise
My main area of ​​interest is front-end development, where I became an expert in creating user-friendly and interactive web applications. I have a solid knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and I have advanced skills in using popular frameworks and libraries such as React. In addition, I have knowledge in back-end development with Java, C# and Python.

What I really love about front-end work is the opportunity to combine my creativity with my problem-solving skills to deliver exceptional user experiences.
